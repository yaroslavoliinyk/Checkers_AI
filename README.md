	Launching the program
1. Dowload the repository
2. Extract the program in "Downloads" folder
3. Use the following command: "cd ~/Downloads/Checkers_AI/checkers/out/production/checkers/"
4. Then use: "java Checkers"
5. Well done! The program is running.

	Interface and controlling
1. Firstly, the program suggests you to choose the level of your competitor. From 1 to 10 when 1 is the weakest competitor and 10 is the strongest
2. After you'll see the following table:
   A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  
1  O  #  O  #  O  #  O  # 
2  #  O  #  O  #  O  #  O 
3  O  #  O  #  O  #  O  # 
4  #     #     #     #    
5     #     #     #     # 
6  #  @  #  @  #  @  #  @ 
7  @  #  @  #  @  #  @  # 
8  #  @  #  @  #  @  #  @ 

Here, your checkers are represented as 'O', the enemy's are '@'

3. In order to make a move you need to type the position of the checker you want to move, for instance:
'A3' - the very left checker.
4. After, you should write a position where you want to go. From 'A3' the only one move is to 'B4'.
That's what we will write.
5. You need to wait until your opponent makes a move and you will proceed.
6. The game wil end until you or AI bot wins.
7. Have fun!
