	##Interface and controlling
* Firstly, the program suggests you to choose the level of your competitor.
From 1 to 10 when 1 is the weakest competitor and 10 is the strongest

* Then the table will appear. Here, your checkers are represented as 'O', the enemy's are '@'
>![The table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yaroslavoliinyk/checkers_AI/master/pics/2.png)
* In order to make a move you need to type the position of the checker you want to move, for instance:
'A3' - the very left checker.
* After, you should write a position where you want to go. From 'A3' the only one move is to 'B4'.
That's what we will write.
It looks as following:

	* The table will affect the changes:

* You need to wait until your opponent makes a move and you will proceed.
Here's an opponent's move:

* Then, you make a move again:
