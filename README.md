	Launching the program
1. Download the repository
2. Extract the program in "Downloads" folder
3. Use the following command: "*cd ~/Downloads/Checkers_AI/checkers/out/production/checkers/*"
4. Then use: "*java Checkers*"
5. Well done! The program is running.

	Interface and controlling
1. Firstly, the program suggests you to choose the level of your competitor. From 1 to 10 when 1 is the weakest competitor and 10 is the strongest
2. Then the table will appear. Here, your checkers are represented as 'O', the enemy's are '@'

3. In order to make a move you need to type the position of the checker you want to move, for instance:
'A3' - the very left checker.
4. After, you should write a position where you want to go. From 'A3' the only one move is to 'B4'.
That's what we will write.
5. You need to wait until your opponent makes a move and you will proceed.
6. The game will end until you or AI bot wins.
7. Have fun!
